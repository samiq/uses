# Cobalt2
[Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos) made his `Cobalt2` theme famous via his amazing courses and I happen to have give in to the hype.

Below are versions of the `Cobalt2` theme for the Mac's Terminal app and for Zsh.

- [cobalt2.terminal](cobalt2.terminal)
- [cobalt2.zsh-theme](cobalt2.zsh-theme)

Instructions on how to use them have been added to the Terminal reference on both [Mac](../../mac/terminal.md) and [Windows](../../windows/terminal.md), there are also instructions for Hyper and [Visual Studio Code](../../vscode.md) in there.
